\section{Why Spectral Elements}

Many different concepts have been used in the last decades for seismological simulations. 
While the Finite Difference (FD) Method is the easiest in terms of implementation, it is not suitable for 
complex geometries due to its regular grid. % (This should probably be explained better, problems with cubic elements and curved surfaces ...
Furthermore numerical dispersion errors limit the accuracy of this method.
The Pseudospectral Method offers much better accuracy, however the required global communications do not allow the 
implementation on parallel hardware. Without parallelisation large simulations like in this work are downright impossible.
This leaves then to choose between the Discontinuous Galerkin Method and the Spectral Element Method. As the latter one 
is already well established in the seismological community and the adjoint inversions have been performed before with the
SPECFEM software, I choose the SEM for this work. 
% DG harder to implement, SEM methods bit faster to run, should SeisSol be mentioned here? 
% This sentence here or in the next section? Also maybe with explanations for each advantage
The Spectral Element Method is characterised by its geometrical flexibility, small numerical errors (exact in the space domain), 
efficiency on parallel hardware and implicit free surface boundary conditions. 
The latter point makes this method especially suitable for surface wave simulation. % is this relevant? 

\section{Basic Concepts of the Spectral Element Method}

% How should Heiner's book be cited?

The equation that has to be solved with the SEM is the elastic wave equation. The one dimensional case is: 

\begin{equation}\label{1Dwave}
\rho(x) \ddot{u}(x,t) -  \partial_x \left[ \mu(x) \partial_x u(x,t) \right] = f(x,t)
\end{equation}

Where $\rho$ is the density, $u$ the unknown function (displacement), $\mu$ the shear modulus and $f$ the source or external forces.

The unknown function is approximated by superposing a finite amount of basis functions and the equation can then be written in matrix 
notation as follows: 

\begin{equation}\label{matrix_equation}
\underbrace{\textbf{M}}_{\text{Mass matrix}} \cdot \ \ddot{\textbf {u}} (t)  \ + \underbrace{\textbf{K}}_{\text{Stiffness matrix}} \cdot \ \textbf{u} (t) \, = \, \underbrace{\textbf{f} (t)}_{\text{Source term}} 
\end{equation}

%the mass matrix is defined as 
%\begin{equation} \label{mass}
%M_{ji} \ = \ \int_{G} \rho(x) \ \psi_j(x) \ \psi_i(x)  \ \mathrm{d}x
%\end{equation}
%
%the stiffness matrix is defined as 
%\begin{equation} \label{stiffness}
%K_{ji} \ = \ \int_{G} \mu(x) \ \partial_x \psi_j(x) \ \partial_x \psi_i(x) \ \mathrm{d}x
%\end{equation}

This equation is solved for every element in the domain. 
As the solution has to be found numerically the problem has to be discretised. 
The whole domain is therefore divided in mesh elements, which reflect the topography and internal discontinuities.
The elements can have different mechanical properties so that complex heterogeneous media can be modelled. 
Each element contains then an equal number of unevenly spaced (denser at the boundaries) grid points, the 
Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) collocation points.
The interpolation with Lagrange polynomials as basis functions is exact at these grid points. 
%For each element in the domain the unknown function $u$ is exactly interpolated with Lagrange polynomials at unevenly spaced 
%(denser at the boundaries) grid points, the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) collocation points. 
The order of the Lagrange polynomials determines the number of collocation points per element and subsequently the accuracy of the simulation. 

Stress free boundary conditions are applied, which represent the stress free state at the Earth's surface. 

As also the numerical integration is performed by GLL quadrature with the use of Lagrange basis functions, the orthogonality of these polynomials 
leads to a diagonal mass matrix, which makes explicit extrapolation possible. This is the main reason for the efficiency of the Spectral Element Method.

The elemental solutions that overlap at their boundaries are then put together in a global system. 
This global set of equations is then extrapolated with a Finite Difference scheme.
Numerical errors of the FD method together with inaccuracies of the numerical integration determine the total error of the SEM.



\section{Introduction to SPECFEM}

SPECFEM \cite{Vilotte1998} was started by Dimitri Komatitsch and Jean-Pierre Vilotte in Paris at the Institut de Physique du Globe (IPGP) in the nineties 
and later expanded by Jeroen Tromp and many others. 
It is used for seismic wave propagation simulations on global and regional scale. 
The software is written in Fortran2003. \\

own mesher, hexahedral elements (cubes) are used for SPECFEM \\
partionining of mesh and distribution with MPI (Message Passing Interface) on several CPUs 

In this work I use the Version SPECFEM3D GLOBE (Version 7.0).
