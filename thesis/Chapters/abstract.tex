In this Master thesis the first steps towards a continental scale seismic full waveform inversions 
using the adjoint method are performed. 
Additionally the Large Scale Seismic Inversion Framework 
(LASIF) is tested and optimized for inversions using the SPECFEM3D GLOBE solver.
The geographical region of interest for the inversion is Antarctica. \\
% 
Waveforms are downloaded for 50 earthquakes and processed with LASIF tools. 
Synthetic waveforms are generated with SPECFEM3D and their misfit to the observed data is used
to compute adjoint sources for the adjoint kernel simulations. 
The event kernels are then summed up to acquire the misfit kernel and smoothing is applied to the kernel.
The misfit kernel gives gives information where the results differ from the initial Earth model CSEM.
In further research the here completed steps could be used to update the initial velocity model and 
proceed with more iterations.\\
This thesis also serves as guide on how to do adjoint simulations with SPECFEM3D Globe with the 
help of LASIF.
