\chapter{Introduction}



\begin{itemize}
\item What is inversion and tomography 
\item What is the adjoint method
\item Why Antarctica
\item Geology of Antarctica
\item Previous Research on Antarctica
\item First steps towards improvement of global scale shear wave velocity models like S20RTS within the Comprehensive Earth Model by means of full seismic waveform inversion using the adjoint technique. 
\item Due to limited time the simulations will only be performed for relatively low frequencies and a few iterations.
\item Test how well SPECFEM 3D Globe integrates with the Large Scale Seismic Inversion Framework.
\end{itemize}
