\part{Data acquisition and processing}

For the selection of the earthquakes the built-in LASIF feature 
add\_gcmt\_events is used to select 50 events equally distributed in the
domain. The earthquakes cover a range of Moment Magnitudes between 5.2 and 6.3. 
No larger events were chosen as the point source approximation would not hold otherwise. 
The events are relatively equally distributed between 2005 and 2014. No events before 2005 can 
be downloaded by LASIF, which is not a problem as the instrumentation at before then was very scarce on Antarctica.
