@article{Roult1994a,
abstract = {To improve the lateral resolution of three-dimensional seismic wave velocity models in Antarctica and the surrounding oceans, we have analysed direct earthquake-to-station Rayleigh-wave data observed on the vertical high-gain long-period and the very long period components of seven GEOSCOPE stations located in the southern hemisphere and three other stations at equatorial latitudes. The phase velocities of Rayleigh waves along 400 well-distributed paths are obtained in the period range 60-300 s, by fitting the data with synthetic seismograms computed with known source parameters in a reference earth model represented by the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM). Corrections for shallow layers have been carefully applied to the observed phase velocities. The geographical distributions of phase velocities and azimuthal anisotropy are then computed with the tomographic method without any a priori regionalization developed by Montagner (Ann. Geophys., 4(B3): 283-294, 1986). The results show some new and important features of Antarctica and the southern hemisphere. The locations of velocity anomalies are well resolved. The eastern part of Antarctica corresponds to a craton-like structure down to depths of about 250 km, and the highest velocities are observed in Enderby Land, where some of the oldest rocks in the world have been sampled. The low velocities are located along the ridges encircling the Antarctic continent. The lowest velocities appear in some areas corresponding to hotspots (Crozet, Kerguelen, Macquarie and Balleny Islands). Also, an elongated low velocity is found on the western flank of the Transantarctic Mountains, which might be related to the existence of a rift zone similar to the African rift. The Australia-Antarctica Discordance (AAD) presents slow velocities near the surface but fast velocities below the lithosphere. These main features are discussed in the framework of the Gondwana hypothesis and the earlier supercontinent. The first azimuthal anisotropy results are also discussed. Anisotropy values are smaller within the Antarctic continent than in the surrounding oceans. They are also small in the AAD but particularly large in the areas around it, suggesting an active tectonic process characterized by a downward flow at depth, a good candidate for a cold spot or a new subduction zone.},

@article{Woodhouse1984,
abstract = {A method is presented for the inversion of waveform data for the three-dimensional distribution of seismic wave velocities. The method is applied to data from the global digital networks (International Deployment of Accelerometers, Global Digital Seismograph Network); the selected data set consists of some 2000 seismograms corresponding to 53 events and 870 paths. The moment tensors of the earthquakes are determined through an iterative procedure which minimizes the corrupting influence of lateral heterogeneity. A global model is constructed for shear wave velocity, expanded up to degree and order 8 in spherical harmonics, and described by a cubic polynomial in depth for the upper 670 km of the earth's mantle. Although no a priori information is incorporated, the model predictions reproduce much of what is known about the dispersion of mantle waves, for example, high phase velocities for shields, low velocities at ridges, and a strong degree 2 pattern for Rayleigh waves. Since the method makes use of complete waveforms, overtone data are also included. It is shown that the model is reproducible in that substantially the same model can be constructed from each half of the total data set considered independently. The model shows that shields and ridges are major features in the depth interval 25–250 km. The ridges of the southern Pacific and the larger shields persist to 350 km, but the SouthEast Indian Rise is underlain by a high-velocity anomaly at this depth, as is much of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. At 450–650 km the major features are a broad region of high velocities incorporating South America, much of the South Atlantic and parts of West Africa, a broad region of low velocities in the central and eastern Pacific, high velocities in the western Pacific, and a low-velocity anomaly beneath the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. In the absence of a crustal correction, degrees 2 and 3 show a high positive correlation with the geoid; paradoxically, this is largely destroyed when the distribution in crustal thickness is taken into account. Spherical harmonic degrees 4–7 show a significant negative correlation.},

@article{Midzi2001,
abstract = {The shear wave velocity structure beneath three southern African stations, Lusaka (LSZ), Lobatse (LBTB) and Boshof (BOSA) were estimated using the time domain inversion of stacked teleseismic receiver functions. Broadband teleseismic 3- component waveform data were used in a source equalisation procedure to estimate radial and transverse receiver functions for each station. The radial receiver functions were stacked according to the following criteria, an azimuthal interval of ±15°, similar ray parameter and shape. For the shield-based stations BOSA and LBTB simpler receiver functions than for LSZ, which is located in the Irumide belt, were obtained. The lateral variation in receiver functions with azimuth as observed at each station stems from lateral heterogeneities beneath each station. The velocity models were presented as P wave velocity models. From these models, the crust mantle transition zones beneath LSZ and BOSA were determined at depths of about 37-44 km and 34-38 km respectively. For LBTB, the northeast quadrant velocity model displayed a clear mantle-continent transition zone in the depth range 40-45 km, whilst the Moho depth in the southern quadrants is not as clear. Beneath all the stations, we observeda low velocity zone, which appears to correlate with the cratonic velocity structure. This feature is consistent with crustal structure results obtained in other cratonic or shield-based crustal studies. The results in this study contribute crustal structure information, which has been lacking at BOSA, LBTB and LSZ. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We propose a probabilistic model to determine landslide hazard at the basin scale. The model predicts where landslides will occur, how frequently they will occur, and how large they will be. We test the model in the Staffora River basin, in the northern Apennines, Italy. For the study area, we prepare a multi-temporal inventory map through the interpretation of multiple sets of aerial photographs taken between 1955 and 1999. We partition the basin into 2243 geo-morpho-hydrological units, and obtain the probability of spatial occurrence of landslides by discriminant analysis of thematic variables, including morphological, lithological, structural and land use. For each mapping unit, we obtain the landslide recurrence by dividing the total number of landslide events inventoried in the unit by the time span of the investigated period. Assuming that landslide recurrence will remain the same in the future, and adopting a Poisson probability model, we determine the exceedance probability of having one or more landslides in each mapping unit, for different periods. We obtain the probability of landslide size by analysing the frequency-area statistics of landslides, obtained from the multi-temporal inventory map. Assuming independence, we obtain a quantitative estimate of landslide hazard for each mapping unit as the joint probability of landslide size, of landslide temporal occurrence and of landslide spatial occurrence.},

@article{Fichtner2006,
abstract = {Sensitivity functionals which allow us to express the total derivative of a physical observable with respect to the model parameters, are defined on the basis of the adjoint method. The definition relies on the existence of Green's functions for both the original and the adjoint problem. Using the acoustic wave equation in a homogeneous and unbounded medium, it is shown that the first derivative of the wavefield u with respect to the model parameter p = c
                        - 2 (c is the wave speed) does not contain traveltime information. This property also influences objective functions defined on u and in particular the least squares objective function. Therefore, a waveform inversion should either be complemented by a traveltime tomography or work with initially very long wavelengths that decrease in the course of the iteration. The definition of the sensitivity functionals naturally introduces waveform sensitivity kernels. Analytic examples are shown for the case of an isotropic, elastic and unbounded medium. In the case of a double couple source there are three classes of sensitivity kernels, one for each of the parameters ??, ?? (Lam?? parameters) and ?? (density). They decompose into P??? P, P??? S, S??? P and S??? S kernels and can be described by third-order tensors incorporating the radiation patterns of the original wavefield and the adjoint wavefield. An analysis of the sensitivity kernels for density suggests that a waveform inversion procedure should exclude either the direct waves or the source and receiver regions. S-wave sensitivity kernels, corresponding to conversions from or to S-waves, are larger than the kernels corresponding to P-waves only. This implies that S-wave residuals caused by parameter differences between the true Earth model and the numerical model will dominate a waveform inversion that does not account for that effect. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Storegga Slide has affected an area of approximately 95 000 km(2), and a sediment volume in the range of approximately 2400-3200 km(3) has been displaced. Around 250 km(3) of the volume has been deposited as turbidite sediments in the Norway Basin. This volume places the Storegga Slide event as one of the world's largest exposed submarine slides. Based on a comprehensive database, detailed morphological investigations and a dating programme have been performed to reveal the slide process and the timing of the slide. To date the slide event, detailed analyses of 89 cores within the Storegga Slide region have been undertaken. The investigations conclude: (a) The main Storegga Slide event represents one retrogressive event dated to be 7250 250 C-14 yrs BP or approximately 8100 250 cal. yrs BP. This age also corresponds with the age of a tsunami found along the western coast of Norway. (b) A few minor slide/slump events have been identified along the northern Storegga Slide escarpment, dated to be c. 5000 C-14 yrs BP and 2500-3000 C-14 yrs BP or approximately 5700 and 2200-2800 cal. yrs BP. The total volume of these events is interpreted to be less than 1 km(3) or c. 0.1\% of the total volume calculated for the main Storegga Slide event. (c) The statistical analyses carried out on the lobes morphometrical parameters show a fairly good correlation (R-2=0.8-0.9) between the smallest and the medium/large size debris lobes within the Ormen Lange Field area. This means that the theological properties for this area can be described as fairly uniform for the slide masses and scaling of the morphometrical parameters should be possible with a great confidence.

abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a challenging data-fitting procedure based on full-wavefield modeling to extract quantitative information from seismograms. High-resolution imaging at half the propagated wavelength is expected. Recent advances in high-performance computing and multifold/multicomponent wide-aperture and wide-azimuth acquisitions make 3D acoustic FWI feasible today. Key ingredients of FWI are an efficient forward-modeling engine and a local differential approach, in which the gradient and the Hessian operators are efficiently estimated. Local optimization does not, however, prevent convergence of the misfit function toward local minima because of the limited accuracy of the starting model, the lack of low frequencies, the presence of noise, and the approximate modeling of thewave-physics complexity. Different hierarchical multiscale strategies are designed to mitigate the nonlinearity and ill-posedness of FWI by incorporating progressively shorter wavelengths in the parameter space. Synthetic and real-data case studies address reconstructing various parameters, from V P and V S velocities to density, anisotropy, and attenuation. This review attempts to illuminate the state of the art of FWI. Crucial jumps, however, remain necessary to make it as popular as migration techniques. The challenges can be categorized as (1) building accurate starting models with automatic procedures and/or recording low frequencies, (2) defining new minimization criteria to mitigate the sensitivity of FWI to amplitude errors and increasing the robustness of FWI when multiple parameter classes are estimated, and (3) improving computational efficiency by data-compression techniques to make 3D elastic FWI feasible.

The new crustal model reveals strong heterogeneity, including local changes of +/-30\% with respect to the initial three-dimensional model provided by the Southern California Earthquake Center. The model illuminates shallow features such as sedimentary basins and compositional contrasts across faults. It also reveals crustal features at depth that aid in the tectonic reconstruction of southern California, such as subduction-captured oceanic crustal fragments. The new model enables more realistic and accurate assessments of seismic hazard.},

abstract = {To improve the lateral resolution of three-dimensional seismic wave velocity models in Antarctica and the surrounding oceans, we have analysed direct earthquake-to-station Rayleigh-wave data observed on the vertical high-gain long-period and the very long period components of seven GEOSCOPE stations located in the southern hemisphere and three other stations at equatorial latitudes. The phase velocities of Rayleigh waves along 400 well-distributed paths are obtained in the period range 60-300 s, by fitting the data with synthetic seismograms computed with known source parameters in a reference earth model represented by the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM). Corrections for shallow layers have been carefully applied to the observed phase velocities. The geographical distributions of phase velocities and azimuthal anisotropy are then computed with the tomographic method without any a priori regionalization developed by Montagner (Ann. Geophys., 4(B3): 283-294, 1986). The results show some new and important features of Antarctica and the southern hemisphere. The locations of velocity anomalies are well resolved. The eastern part of Antarctica corresponds to a craton-like structure down to depths of about 250 km, and the highest velocities are observed in Enderby Land, where some of the oldest rocks in the world have been sampled. The low velocities are located along the ridges encircling the Antarctic continent. The lowest velocities appear in some areas corresponding to hotspots (Crozet, Kerguelen, Macquarie and Balleny Islands). Also, an elongated low velocity is found on the western flank of the Transantarctic Mountains, which might be related to the existence of a rift zone similar to the African rift. The Australia-Antarctica Discordance (AAD) presents slow velocities near the surface but fast velocities below the lithosphere. These main features are discussed in the framework of the Gondwana hypothesis and the earlier supercontinent. The first azimuthal anisotropy results are also discussed. Anisotropy values are smaller within the Antarctic continent than in the surrounding oceans. They are also small in the AAD but particularly large in the areas around it, suggesting an active tectonic process characterized by a downward flow at depth, a good candidate for a cold spot or a new subduction zone.},

Finally, we discuss the challenge of using the remaining differences between the data and the synthetic seismograms to constrain better Earth models and source descriptions.

The existing regional Earth models reviewed are very simple because of poor processing facilities. The availability of high-quality data, obtained with the GEOSCOPE network in this part of the southern hemisphere, has recently led to the construction of maps of lateral heterogeneities of Antarctica with an improved resolution.

abstract = {Carbon isotope records across the Latest Palaeocene Thermal Maximum (LPTM) display by a remarkable delta(13)C excursion of at least -2.5 parts per thousand that occurred within 10 x 10(3) yrs. Thermal dissociation of marine gas hydrate and release of massive quantities of CH4 to the exogenic carbon cycle appears to be the only plausible explanation for this geochemical perturbation. Three numerical simulations of the scenario are compared here. Each simulation involved release of 1.12 x 10(18) g of CH4 over 10 x 103 yrs into the pre-industrial steady-state exogenic carbon cycle. The only difference between the simulations is whether CH4 was oxidized in the atmosphere, deep Atlantic Ocean, or deep Pacific Ocean. Important conclusions from this work are that massive CH4 release into any carbon reservoir will cause a negative delta(13)C excursion, increased atmosphere pCO(2), elevated global surface temperature, and pelagic carbonate dissolution, but that the timing and magnitude of these responses depends on the location of CH4 oxidation. Oxygen deficiency must also occur if significant quantities of CH4 are oxidized in an ocean reservoir. Release and oxidation of massive quantities of CH4 in the deep Atlantic Ocean is consistent with several observations from the geological record across the LPTM. However, key data sets and additional modeling are needed before geochemical perturbations during this extraordinary time interval can be well understood.},

A curve showing climatic fluctuations according to a number of glacials, interglacials, and temperate oscillations of small amplitude or short duration (interstadials) is given, and the value of pollen records in this context is discussed. Because the position of the individual intervals with known vegetational development on the total timescale is controlled by superposition, the lithostratigraphic position of some of them is reviewed. Basic differences in vegetational evolution between the Tiglian, Waalian, and later interglacials, as well as the extinction of certain trees at around the time of the transition of the Early-Middle Pleistocene, probably indicate lower temperatures during the glacials which have occurred in the past million years. Although the established record shows some resemblance to the oxygen-isotope curve of the deep sea, precise correlation is not yet possible. A tentative correlation is discussed.},

abstract = {The late Cenozoic climate of Africa is a critical component for understanding human evolution. African climate is controlled by major tectonic changes, global climate transitions, and local variations in orbital forcing. We introduce the special African Paleoclimate Issue of the Journal of Human Evolution by providing a background for and synthesis of the latest work relating to the environmental context for human evolution. Records presented in this special issue suggest that the regional tectonics, appearance of C-4 plants in East Africa, and late Cenozoic global cooling combined to produce a long-term drying trend in East Africa. Of particular importance is the uplift associated with the East African Rift Valley formation, which altered wind flow patterns from a more zonal to more meridinal direction. Results in this volume suggest a marked difference in the climate history of southern and eastern Africa, though both are clearly influenced by the major global climate thresholds crossed in the last 3 million years. Papers in this volume present lake, speleothem, and marine paleoclimate records showing that the East African long-term drying trend is punctuated by episodes of short, alternating periods of extreme wetness and aridity. These periods of extreme climate variability are characterized by the precession-forced appearance and disappearance of large, deep lakes in the East African Rift Valley and paralleled by low and high wind-driven dust loads reaching the adjacent ocean basins. Dating of these records show that over the last 3 million years such periods only occur at the times of major global climatic transitions, such as the intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (2.7-2.5 Ma), intensification of the Walker Circulation (1.9-1.7 Ma), and the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution (1-0.7 Ma). Authors in this volume suggest this onset occurs as high latitude forcing in both Hemispheres compresses the Intertropical Convergence Zone so that East Africa becomes locally sensitive to precessional forcing, resulting in rapid shifts from wet to dry conditions. These periods of extreme climate variability may have provided a catalyst for evolutionary change and driven key speciation and dispersal events amongst mammals and hominins in Africa. In particular, hominin species seem to differentially originate and go extinct during periods of extreme climate variability. Results presented in this volume may represent the basis of a new theory of early human evolution in Africa. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {[ 1] This study uses seismic receiver functions, surface wave phase velocities, and airborne gravity measurements to investigate the structure of the Transantarctic Mountains ( TAM) and adjacent regions of the Ross Sea ( RS) and East Antarctica ( EA). Forty-one broadband seismometers deployed during the Transantarctic Mountain Seismic Experiment provide new insight into the differences between the TAM, RS, and EA crust and mantle. Combined receiver function and phase velocity inversion with niching genetic algorithms produces accurate crustal and upper mantle seismic velocity models. The crustal thickness increases from 20 +/- 2 km in the RS to a maximum of 40 +/- 2 km beneath the crest of the TAM at 110 +/- 10 km inland. Farther inland, the crust of EA is uniformly 35 +/- 3 km thick over a lateral distance greater than 1300 km. Upper mantle shear wave velocities vary from 4.5 km s(-1) beneath EA to 4.2 km s(-1) beneath RS, with a transition between the two at 100 +/- 50 km inland near the crest of the TAM. The similar to 5 km thick crustal root beneath the TAM has an insufficient buoyant load to explain the entire TAM uplift, suggesting some portion of the uplift may result from flexure associated with a buoyant thermal load in the mantle beneath the edge of the TAM lithosphere.},

abstract = {New empirical traveltime curves for the major seismic phases have been derived from the catalogues of the International Seismological Centre by relocating events by using P readings, depth phases and the iasp91 traveltimes, and then re-associating phase picks. A smoothed set of traveltime tables is extracted by a robust procedure which gives estimates of the variance of the traveltimes for each phase branch. This set of smoothed empirical times is then used to construct a range of radial velocity profiles, which are assessed against a number of different measures of the level of fit between the empirical times and the predictions of the models. These measures are constructed from weighted sums of L2 misfits for individual phases. The weights are chosen to provide a measure of the probable reliability of the picks for the different phases. A preferred model, ak1.?5, is proposed which gives a significantly better fit to a broad range of phases than is provided by the iusp9I and sp6 models. The differences in velocity between ak135 and these models are generally quite small except at the boundary of the inner core, where reduced velocity gradients are needed to achieve satisfactory performance for PKP differential time data. The potential resolution of velocity structure has been assessed with the aid of a non-linear search procedure in which 5000 models have been generated in bounds about ak135. Misfit calculations are performed for each of the phases in the empirical traveltime sets, and the models are then sorted using different overall measures of misfit. The best 100 models for each criterion are displayed in a model density plot which indicates the consistency of the different models. The interaction of information from different phases can be analysed by comparing the different misfit measures. Structure in the mantle is well resolved except at the base, and ak135 provides a good representation of core velocities.},

abstract = {The Transantarctic Mountains are a major rift-related mountain belt bisecting the Antarctic continent. The range is located on the tectonic boundary between non-cratonic West and cratonic East Antarctica. Formation of the mountain range and a possible relation with the West Antarctic Rift system are unclear. In this study, we find a new explanation for uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains and suggest a relation between uplift of the range, formation of a small crustal root, depression of the hinterland Wilkes Basin, and the formation of the adjacent West Antarctic Rift system. Numerical models show that upon extension of the Antarctic lithosphere, the West Antarctic Rift system is formed on the tectonic boundary between East and West Antarctica. Convergence of crustal material results in crustal thickening and uplift of the Earth's surface on the cratonic side of this rift zone, and formation of the Transantarctic Mountains. Some models predict a depression in the hinterland of the mountain range at the location of the Wilkes Basin. These models predict that the Wilkes Basin is a non-extensional basin caused by flexure of the lithosphere. This study shows that inherited lithosphere structures play an important role in localization of both extensional and convergent deformation. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Using an inversion strategy based on adjoint methods, we developed a three-dimensional seismological model of the southern California crust. The resulting model involved 16 tomographic iterations, which required 6800 wavefield simulations and a total of 0.8 million central processing unit hours. The new crustal model reveals strong heterogeneity, including local changes of +/-30\% with respect to the initial three-dimensional model provided by the Southern California Earthquake Center. The model illuminates shallow features such as sedimentary basins and compositional contrasts across faults. It also reveals crustal features at depth that aid in the tectonic reconstruction of southern California, such as subduction-captured oceanic crustal fragments. The new model enables more realistic and accurate assessments of seismic hazard.},

abstract = {Images of the European crust and upper mantle, created using seismic tomography, identify the Cenozoic Rift System and related volcanism in central and western Europe. They also reveal subduction and slab roll back in the MediterraneanCarpathian region1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. However, existing tomographic models are either high in resolution, but cover only a limited area13, 14, or low in resolution, and thus miss the finer-scale details of mantle structure5, 12. Here we simultaneously fit frequency-dependent phase anomalies of body and surface waveforms in complete three-component seismograms with an iterative inversion strategy involving adjoint methods, to create a tomographic model of the European upper mantle. We find that many of the smaller-scale structures such as slabs, upwellings and delaminations that emerge naturally in our model are consistent with existing images. However, we also derive some hitherto unidentified structures. Specifically, we interpret fast seismic-wave speeds beneath the Dinarides Mountains, southern Europe, as a signature of northeastward subduction of the Adria plate; slow seismic-wave speeds beneath the northern part of the Rhine Graben as a reservoir connected to the Eifel hotspot; and fast wave-speed anomalies beneath Scandinavia as a lithospheric drip, where the lithosphere is delaminating and breaking away. Our model sheds new light on the enigmatic palaeotectonic history of Europe.},

abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {[ 1] This study uses seismic receiver functions, surface wave phase velocities, and airborne gravity measurements to investigate the structure of the Transantarctic Mountains ( TAM) and adjacent regions of the Ross Sea ( RS) and East Antarctica ( EA). Forty-one broadband seismometers deployed during the Transantarctic Mountain Seismic Experiment provide new insight into the differences between the TAM, RS, and EA crust and mantle. Combined receiver function and phase velocity inversion with niching genetic algorithms produces accurate crustal and upper mantle seismic velocity models. The crustal thickness increases from 20 +/- 2 km in the RS to a maximum of 40 +/- 2 km beneath the crest of the TAM at 110 +/- 10 km inland. Farther inland, the crust of EA is uniformly 35 +/- 3 km thick over a lateral distance greater than 1300 km. Upper mantle shear wave velocities vary from 4.5 km s(-1) beneath EA to 4.2 km s(-1) beneath RS, with a transition between the two at 100 +/- 50 km inland near the crest of the TAM. The similar to 5 km thick crustal root beneath the TAM has an insufficient buoyant load to explain the entire TAM uplift, suggesting some portion of the uplift may result from flexure associated with a buoyant thermal load in the mantle beneath the edge of the TAM lithosphere.},
