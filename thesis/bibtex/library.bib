abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Following a brief review of the basic equations that govern seismic wave propagation, we discuss in some detail how these equations may be solved numerically based upon the SEM to address the forward problem in seismology. Examples of synthetic seismograms, calculated based upon the SEM are compared to data recorded by the Global Seismographic Network. Finally, we discuss the challenge of using the remaining differences between the data and the synthetic seismograms to constrain better Earth models and source descriptions. This leads naturally to adjoint methods, which provide a practical approach to this formidable computational challenge and enables seismologists to tackle the inverse problem.},

@article{Maslin2007,
abstract = {The late Cenozoic climate of Africa is a critical component for understanding human evolution. African climate is controlled by major tectonic changes, global climate transitions, and local variations in orbital forcing. We introduce the special African Paleoclimate Issue of the Journal of Human Evolution by providing a background for and synthesis of the latest work relating to the environmental context for human evolution. Records presented in this special issue suggest that the regional tectonics, appearance of C-4 plants in East Africa, and late Cenozoic global cooling combined to produce a long-term drying trend in East Africa. Of particular importance is the uplift associated with the East African Rift Valley formation, which altered wind flow patterns from a more zonal to more meridinal direction. Results in this volume suggest a marked difference in the climate history of southern and eastern Africa, though both are clearly influenced by the major global climate thresholds crossed in the last 3 million years. Papers in this volume present lake, speleothem, and marine paleoclimate records showing that the East African long-term drying trend is punctuated by episodes of short, alternating periods of extreme wetness and aridity. These periods of extreme climate variability are characterized by the precession-forced appearance and disappearance of large, deep lakes in the East African Rift Valley and paralleled by low and high wind-driven dust loads reaching the adjacent ocean basins. Dating of these records show that over the last 3 million years such periods only occur at the times of major global climatic transitions, such as the intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (2.7-2.5 Ma), intensification of the Walker Circulation (1.9-1.7 Ma), and the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution (1-0.7 Ma). Authors in this volume suggest this onset occurs as high latitude forcing in both Hemispheres compresses the Intertropical Convergence Zone so that East Africa becomes locally sensitive to precessional forcing, resulting in rapid shifts from wet to dry conditions. These periods of extreme climate variability may have provided a catalyst for evolutionary change and driven key speciation and dispersal events amongst mammals and hominins in Africa. In particular, hominin species seem to differentially originate and go extinct during periods of extreme climate variability. Results presented in this volume may represent the basis of a new theory of early human evolution in Africa. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The shear wave velocity structure beneath three southern African stations, Lusaka (LSZ), Lobatse (LBTB) and Boshof (BOSA) were estimated using the time domain inversion of stacked teleseismic receiver functions. Broadband teleseismic 3- component waveform data were used in a source equalisation procedure to estimate radial and transverse receiver functions for each station. The radial receiver functions were stacked according to the following criteria, an azimuthal interval of Â±15Â°, similar ray parameter and shape. For the shield-based stations BOSA and LBTB simpler receiver functions than for LSZ, which is located in the Irumide belt, were obtained. The lateral variation in receiver functions with azimuth as observed at each station stems from lateral heterogeneities beneath each station. The velocity models were presented as P wave velocity models. From these models, the crust mantle transition zones beneath LSZ and BOSA were determined at depths of about 37-44 km and 34-38 km respectively. For LBTB, the northeast quadrant velocity model displayed a clear mantle-continent transition zone in the depth range 40-45 km, whilst the Moho depth in the southern quadrants is not as clear. Beneath all the stations, we observeda low velocity zone, which appears to correlate with the cratonic velocity structure. This feature is consistent with crustal structure results obtained in other cratonic or shield-based crustal studies. The results in this study contribute crustal structure information, which has been lacking at BOSA, LBTB and LSZ. Â© 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Storegga Slide has affected an area of approximately 95 000 km(2), and a sediment volume in the range of approximately 2400-3200 km(3) has been displaced. Around 250 km(3) of the volume has been deposited as turbidite sediments in the Norway Basin. This volume places the Storegga Slide event as one of the world's largest exposed submarine slides. Based on a comprehensive database, detailed morphological investigations and a dating programme have been performed to reveal the slide process and the timing of the slide. To date the slide event, detailed analyses of 89 cores within the Storegga Slide region have been undertaken. The investigations conclude: (a) The main Storegga Slide event represents one retrogressive event dated to be 7250 250 C-14 yrs BP or approximately 8100 250 cal. yrs BP. This age also corresponds with the age of a tsunami found along the western coast of Norway. (b) A few minor slide/slump events have been identified along the northern Storegga Slide escarpment, dated to be c. 5000 C-14 yrs BP and 2500-3000 C-14 yrs BP or approximately 5700 and 2200-2800 cal. yrs BP. The total volume of these events is interpreted to be less than 1 km(3) or c. 0.1\% of the total volume calculated for the main Storegga Slide event. (c) The statistical analyses carried out on the lobes morphometrical parameters show a fairly good correlation (R-2=0.8-0.9) between the smallest and the medium/large size debris lobes within the Ormen Lange Field area. This means that the theological properties for this area can be described as fairly uniform for the slide masses and scaling of the morphometrical parameters should be possible with a great confidence.

abstract = {Using an inversion strategy based on adjoint methods, we developed a three-dimensional seismological model of the southern California crust. The resulting model involved 16 tomographic iterations, which required 6800 wavefield simulations and a total of 0.8 million central processing unit hours. The new crustal model reveals strong heterogeneity, including local changes of +/-30\% with respect to the initial three-dimensional model provided by the Southern California Earthquake Center. The model illuminates shallow features such as sedimentary basins and compositional contrasts across faults. It also reveals crustal features at depth that aid in the tectonic reconstruction of southern California, such as subduction-captured oceanic crustal fragments. The new model enables more realistic and accurate assessments of seismic hazard.},

abstract = {Sensitivity functionals which allow us to express the total derivative of a physical observable with respect to the model parameters, are defined on the basis of the adjoint method. The definition relies on the existence of Green's functions for both the original and the adjoint problem. Using the acoustic wave equation in a homogeneous and unbounded medium, it is shown that the first derivative of the wavefield u with respect to the model parameter p = c
                        - 2 (c is the wave speed) does not contain traveltime information. This property also influences objective functions defined on u and in particular the least squares objective function. Therefore, a waveform inversion should either be complemented by a traveltime tomography or work with initially very long wavelengths that decrease in the course of the iteration. The definition of the sensitivity functionals naturally introduces waveform sensitivity kernels. Analytic examples are shown for the case of an isotropic, elastic and unbounded medium. In the case of a double couple source there are three classes of sensitivity kernels, one for each of the parameters ??, ?? (Lam?? parameters) and ?? (density). They decompose into P??? P, P??? S, S??? P and S??? S kernels and can be described by third-order tensors incorporating the radiation patterns of the original wavefield and the adjoint wavefield. An analysis of the sensitivity kernels for density suggests that a waveform inversion procedure should exclude either the direct waves or the source and receiver regions. S-wave sensitivity kernels, corresponding to conversions from or to S-waves, are larger than the kernels corresponding to P-waves only. This implies that S-wave residuals caused by parameter differences between the true Earth model and the numerical model will dominate a waveform inversion that does not account for that effect. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Carbon isotope records across the Latest Palaeocene Thermal Maximum (LPTM) display by a remarkable delta(13)C excursion of at least -2.5 parts per thousand that occurred within 10 x 10(3) yrs. Thermal dissociation of marine gas hydrate and release of massive quantities of CH4 to the exogenic carbon cycle appears to be the only plausible explanation for this geochemical perturbation. Three numerical simulations of the scenario are compared here. Each simulation involved release of 1.12 x 10(18) g of CH4 over 10 x 103 yrs into the pre-industrial steady-state exogenic carbon cycle. The only difference between the simulations is whether CH4 was oxidized in the atmosphere, deep Atlantic Ocean, or deep Pacific Ocean. Important conclusions from this work are that massive CH4 release into any carbon reservoir will cause a negative delta(13)C excursion, increased atmosphere pCO(2), elevated global surface temperature, and pelagic carbonate dissolution, but that the timing and magnitude of these responses depends on the location of CH4 oxidation. Oxygen deficiency must also occur if significant quantities of CH4 are oxidized in an ocean reservoir. Release and oxidation of massive quantities of CH4 in the deep Atlantic Ocean is consistent with several observations from the geological record across the LPTM. However, key data sets and additional modeling are needed before geochemical perturbations during this extraordinary time interval can be well understood.},

abstract = {Images of the European crust and upper mantle, created using seismic tomography, identify the Cenozoic Rift System and related volcanism in central and western Europe. They also reveal subduction and slab roll back in the MediterraneanCarpathian region1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. However, existing tomographic models are either high in resolution, but cover only a limited area13, 14, or low in resolution, and thus miss the finer-scale details of mantle structure5, 12. Here we simultaneously fit frequency-dependent phase anomalies of body and surface waveforms in complete three-component seismograms with an iterative inversion strategy involving adjoint methods, to create a tomographic model of the European upper mantle. We find that many of the smaller-scale structures such as slabs, upwellings and delaminations that emerge naturally in our model are consistent with existing images. However, we also derive some hitherto unidentified structures. Specifically, we interpret fast seismic-wave speeds beneath the Dinarides Mountains, southern Europe, as a signature of northeastward subduction of the Adria plate; slow seismic-wave speeds beneath the northern part of the Rhine Graben as a reservoir connected to the Eifel hotspot; and fast wave-speed anomalies beneath Scandinavia as a lithospheric drip, where the lithosphere is delaminating and breaking away. Our model sheds new light on the enigmatic palaeotectonic history of Europe.},

abstract = {We propose a probabilistic model to determine landslide hazard at the basin scale. The model predicts where landslides will occur, how frequently they will occur, and how large they will be. We test the model in the Staffora River basin, in the northern Apennines, Italy. For the study area, we prepare a multi-temporal inventory map through the interpretation of multiple sets of aerial photographs taken between 1955 and 1999. We partition the basin into 2243 geo-morpho-hydrological units, and obtain the probability of spatial occurrence of landslides by discriminant analysis of thematic variables, including morphological, lithological, structural and land use. For each mapping unit, we obtain the landslide recurrence by dividing the total number of landslide events inventoried in the unit by the time span of the investigated period. Assuming that landslide recurrence will remain the same in the future, and adopting a Poisson probability model, we determine the exceedance probability of having one or more landslides in each mapping unit, for different periods. We obtain the probability of landslide size by analysing the frequency-area statistics of landslides, obtained from the multi-temporal inventory map. Assuming independence, we obtain a quantitative estimate of landslide hazard for each mapping unit as the joint probability of landslide size, of landslide temporal occurrence and of landslide spatial occurrence.},

abstract = {Temperate and cold stages comparable to those of the last interglacial-glacial have alternated for ca. 2.4 Ma, a time-level regarded as the base of the Quaternary. A curve showing climatic fluctuations according to a number of glacials, interglacials, and temperate oscillations of small amplitude or short duration (interstadials) is given, and the value of pollen records in this context is discussed. Because the position of the individual intervals with known vegetational development on the total timescale is controlled by superposition, the lithostratigraphic position of some of them is reviewed. Basic differences in vegetational evolution between the Tiglian, Waalian, and later interglacials, as well as the extinction of certain trees at around the time of the transition of the Early-Middle Pleistocene, probably indicate lower temperatures during the glacials which have occurred in the past million years. Although the established record shows some resemblance to the oxygen-isotope curve of the deep sea, precise correlation is not yet possible. A tentative correlation is discussed.},
